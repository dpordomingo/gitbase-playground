this project follows the guidelines described below.


# Architecture

The application is a go binnary that serves the statics and the API used for the UI.

The statics (`html`, `js` and `css`) are generated by `yarn`, embedded in the go binary using bindata, and served from the binary itself.

There are two main different ways to run the app:

- using released artifacts, as [listed in the README.md#](../README.md#run-the-playground)
- serving the app for development purposes, [building and running it from sources](#run-from-sources)


# Configuration

| Variable | Required | Default value | Meaning |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| `GITBASEPG_HOST` | | `0.0.0.0` | IP address to bind the HTTP server |
| `GITBASEPG_PORT` | | `8080` | Port address to bind the HTTP server |
| `GITBASEPG_SERVER_URL` | | `<GITBASEPG_HOST>:<GITBASEPG_PORT>` | URL used to access the application (i.e. public hostname) |
| `GITBASEPG_DB_CONNECTION` | | `gitbase@tcp(localhost:3306)/none?maxAllowedPacket=4194304` | gitbase connection string |
| `GITBASEPG_BBLFSHD_URL` | | `127.0.0.1:9432` | Address where bblfsh server is listening |
| `GITBASEPG_ENV` | | `production` | Sets the log level. Use `dev` to enable debug log messages |


# Development

## Requirements

You should already have [Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install#install), and properly [configured the $GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/SettingGOPATH)

```
go version; # prints your go version
go env GOPATH; # prints your $GOPATH path
```

The project must be under $GOPATH, as required by the Go tooling.
You should be able to navigate into the source code by running:

```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/src-d/gitbase-playground
```

You need also [Yarn v1.x.x installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

```
yarn --version; # prints your Yarn version
```


## Run from sources

You need to satisfy all [project requirements](#requirements), and then run:

```bash
$ go get -d -u github.com/src-d/gitbase-playground/...
$ cd $GOPATH/github.com/src-d/gitbase-playground
$ make dependencies
$ make serve
```

This will start a server locally, which you can access on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)


## Integration tests

It will test that `gitbase` and `bblfshd` are running and available for the playground.

It is needed to serve under `gitbase` a copy of the `https://github.com/src-d/gitbase-playground` repository

```bash
$ make back-test-integration
```
